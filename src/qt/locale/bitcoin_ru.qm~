When you generated this block, it was broadcast to the network to be added to the block chain. If it fails to get into the chain, its state will change to "not accepted" and it won't be spendable. This may occasionally happen if another node generates a block within a few seconds of yours.   TransactionDesc   E>4K       Inputs   TransactionDesc   !>>1I5=85       Message   TransactionDesc   '8AB0O  AC<<0       Net amount   TransactionDesc   (B:@KB>  4;O   % n  1;>:0   *B:@KB>  4;O   % n  1;>:>2   *B:@KB>  4;O   % n  1;>:>2       Open for %n block(s)   TransactionDesc   B:@KB>  4>   % 1       Open until %1   TransactionDesc   AB>G=8:       Source   TransactionDesc   !B0BCA       Status   TransactionDesc   ;O       To   TransactionDesc   "@0=70:F8O       Transaction   TransactionDesc    I D  B@0=70:F88       Transaction ID   TransactionDesc   ><8AA8O       Transaction fee   TransactionDesc   :>=D;8:B       conflicted   TransactionDesc   ;>6L       false   TransactionDesc   <5B:0       label   TransactionDesc   81C45B  4>ABC?=>  G5@57   % n  1;>:   :1C45B  4>ABC?=>  G5@57   % n  1;>:0   <1C45B  4>ABC?=>  G5@57   % n  1;>:>2       matures in %n more block(s)   TransactionDesc   =5  ?@8=OB>       not accepted   TransactionDesc   A2>9  04@5A       own address   TransactionDesc   8AB8=0       true   TransactionDesc   =58725AB=>       unknown   TransactionDesc   �0==K9  480;>3  ?>:07K205B  45B0;878@>20==CN  AB0B8AB8:C  ?>  2K1@0==>9  B@0=70:F88       9This pane shows a detailed description of the transaction   TransactionDescDialog   "5B0;8  B@0=70:F88       Transaction details   TransactionDescDialog    [=5  4>ABC?=> ]       (n/a)   TransactionTableModel   4@5A       Address   TransactionTableModel   >;8G5AB2>       Amount   TransactionTableModel   R!C<<0 ,  4>102;5==0O ,  8;8  A=OB0O  A  10;0=A0 .       (Amount removed from or added to balance.   TransactionTableModel   >>4B25@645=>   ( % 1  ?>4B25@645=89 )       Confirmed (%1 confirmations)   TransactionTableModel   n>4B25@6405BAO   ( % 1  87   % 2  @5:><5=4>20==KE  ?>4B25@645=89 )       /Confirming (%1 of %2 recommended confirmations)   TransactionTableModel   >=D;8:B       Conflicted   TransactionTableModel   0B0       Date   TransactionTableModel   Z0B0  8  2@5<O ,  :>340  B@0=70:F8O  1K;0  ?>;CG5=0 .       0Date and time that the transaction was received.   TransactionTableModel   84@5A  =07=0G5=8O  B@0=70:F88 .       #Destination address of transaction.   TransactionTableModel   8!35=5@8@>20=> ,  =>  =5  ?@8=OB>       Generated but not accepted   TransactionTableModel   h57@5;K5   ( % 1  ?>4B25@645=89 ,  1C4CB  4>ABC?=K  ?>A;5   % 2 )       7Immature (%1 confirmations, will be available after %2)   TransactionTableModel   >1KB>       Mined   TransactionTableModel   DD;09=       Offline   TransactionTableModel   0B:@KB>  4;O  5IQ   % n  1;>:0   2B:@KB>  4;O  5IQ   % n  1;>:>2   2B:@KB>  4;O  5IQ   % n  1;>:>2       Open for %n more block(s)   TransactionTableModel   B:@KB>  4>   % 1       Open until %1   TransactionTableModel   B?@02;5=>  A515       Payment to yourself   TransactionTableModel   >;CG5=>  >B       Received from   TransactionTableModel   >;CG5=>       Received with   TransactionTableModel   B?@02;5=>       Sent to   TransactionTableModel   �-B>B  1;>:  =5  1K;  ?>;CG5=  4@C38<8  C7;0<8  8 ,  2>7<>6=> ,  =5  1C45B  ?@8=OB !       QThis block was not received by any other nodes and will probably not be accepted!   TransactionTableModel   �!B0BCA  B@0=70:F88 .  >42548B5  :C@A>@  :  =C6=><C  ?>;N  4;O  B>3> ,  GB>1K  C2845BL  :>;8G5AB2>  ?>4B25@645=89 .       JTransaction status.
