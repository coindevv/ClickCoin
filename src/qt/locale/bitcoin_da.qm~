      �%s, you must set a rpcpassword in the configuration file:
 %s
It is recommended you use the following random password:
rpcuser=Mysticoinrpc
rpcpassword=%s
(you do not need to remember this password)
The username and password MUST NOT be the same.
If the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions.
It is also recommended to set alertnotify so you are notified of problems;
for example: alertnotify=echo %%s | mail -s "Mysticoin Alert" admin@foo.com
